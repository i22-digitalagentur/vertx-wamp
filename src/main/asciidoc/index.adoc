= Vert.x WAMP

== Using Vert.x WAMP

This is an unofficial Vert.x component that provides a limited broker component for the basic WAMP profile with JSON over websockets.

These limitations will probably be lifted and functionality be enhanced upon in future releases.

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
    <artifactId>vertx-wamp</artifactId>
    <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile io.vertx:vertx-wamp:${maven.version}

= Vert.x WAMP server

This component provides a server which is able to handle connections, communication and messages exchange with remote
link:https://wamp-proto.org[WAMP] clients.
Right now clients are not supported to publish data themselves.
Instead, you can publish events to a realm and it will be distributed to all clients with subscriptions to them.

As such it's not a fully featured WAMP broker but might be soon.
The same way, the Dealer role for RPC functionality is not supported.

WARNING: this module has the tech preview status, this means the API can change between versions.

== Getting Started

=== Accepting client connections and publishing events

This example shows how to start the Websocket server and publish messages to all subscribed clients in a realm.
First, create a {@link io.vertx.wamp.WAMPWebsocketServer} instance and use {@link io.vertx.wamp.WAMPWebsocketServer#addRealm(io.vertx.wamp.Realm)} to add a realm.
Now you can use {@link io.vertx.wamp.Realm#publishMessage(io.vertx.wamp.messages.PublishMessage) to publish a message.

=== Closing the server

{@link io.vertx.wamp.WAMPWebsocketServer#close()} can be used for shutting down the server.
It initiates the shutdown protocol for all connected clients.
This method is asynchronous and provides an overloaded version which also receives a completion handler that will be called once the server is fully closed.

=== Using a security policy

{@link io.vertx.wamp.WAMPWebsocketServer#withSecurityPolicy(SecurityPolicy)} provides a mechanism for fine-grained control over which client is permitted to perform which action.
Use it if you need to control who is connecting to your server.

=== Automatic clean-up in verticles

If youâ€™re creating WAMP servers from inside verticles, those servers will be automatically closed when the verticle is undeployed.
